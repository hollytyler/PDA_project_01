# A list is a storage container for objects in a program
# which are stored as a part of a collection.

# In this function I have created a list and assigned it to a variable
# I then wanted to find the sum of every item in the list
# so the defined function "sum_of_numbers" will take in the list 
# and then retrun the sum.
